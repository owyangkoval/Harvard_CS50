The text messages CNN obtained begin on Election Day, November 3, 2020. Even before the election was called, Meadows was inundated with conspiracy theories about election fraud, strategies to challenge the results and pleas for Trump to keep fighting.

For months leading up to Election Day, Trump had claimed the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged.
